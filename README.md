# information-retrieval-project

The project involves the following steps:
Data Collection: Develop a web scraping or crawling mechanism to systematically navigate through the University of Memphis website and collect relevant documents. This may involve identifying specific web pages, extracting HTML content, and storing the retrieved documents.
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the retrieved documents to ensure data consistency and improve retrieval performance. This step may include removing HTML tags, normalizing text (e.g., converting to lowercase), removing stop words, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
Indexing: Create an index to facilitate efficient retrieval of documents. The indexing process involves parsing the preprocessed documents, tokenizing the text into individual terms, and building data structures such as inverted indexes that map terms to the documents containing them.
Query Processing: Implement a query processing module that allows users to input search queries and retrieve relevant documents. This module should process the query, tokenize it, apply any necessary preprocessing steps, and match the query terms against the indexed documents to retrieve the most relevant results.
Ranking: Implement a ranking algorithm to order the retrieved documents based on their relevance to the query. This may involve techniques such as term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF), vector space models, or probabilistic models like BM25.
User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the system, input search queries, and view the retrieved documents. The interface should provide an intuitive search experience and display the search results in a meaningful and organized manner.
Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of the information retrieval system using evaluation measures such as precision, recall, F1 score, or mean average precision. This step helps in quantifying the system's performance and identifying areas for improvement.
By successfully implementing an information retrieval system for retrieving 10,000 documents from the University of Memphis website, users will have an efficient and effective tool to access relevant information quickly. The system can benefit students, faculty, staff, and anyone interested in exploring the wealth of knowledge available on the University of Memphis website.
